      Too many people spend money they earned..to buy things they don't want..to
      impress people that they don't like. --Will Rogers A wise person should
      have money in their head, but not in their heart. --Jonathan Swift Wealth
      consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.
      --Epictetus Money often costs too much. --Ralph Waldo Emerson Everyday is
      a bank account, and time is our currency. No one is rich, no one is poor,
      we've got 24 hours each. --Christopher Rice It's how you deal with failure
      that determines how you achieve success. --David Feherty Frugality
      includes all the other virtues. --Cicero I love money. I love everything
      about it. I bought some pretty good stuff. Got me a $300 pair of socks.
      Got a fur sink. An electric dog polisher. A gasoline powered turtleneck
      sweater. And, of course, I bought some dumb stuff, too. --Steve Martin An
      investment in knowledge pays the best interest. --Benjamin Franklin I will
      tell you the secret to getting rich on Wall Street. You try to be greedy
      when others are fearful. And you try to be fearful when others are greedy.
      --Warren Buffett Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen
      six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure
      twenty pound ought and six, result misery. --Charles Dickens Opportunity
      is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like
      work. --Thomas Edison What we really want to do is what we are really
      meant to do. When we do what we are meant to do, money comes to us, doors
      open for us, we feel useful, and the work we do feels like play to us.
      --Julia Cameron I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy
      on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not
      reopen it for ten years. --Warren Buffett A nickel ain't worth a dime
      anymore. --Yogi Berra Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. The
      more a man has, the more he wants. Instead of filling a vacuum, it makes
      one. --Benjamin Franklin Many people take no care of their money till they
      come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.
      --Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Formal education will make you a living;
      self-education will make you a fortune. --Jim Rohn
